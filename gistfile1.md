Please write a ruby script which translate arabic numerals into english numerals.

It should be like

```ruby
$ ruby arabic2english.rb 1
one

$ ruby arabic2english.rb 11
eleven

$ ruby arabic2english.rb 100
one hundred
```

Please implement it step by step with RSpec in multiple commits as you do TDD, so we can get an idea of how you code.
